# Project Instruction 

## Project Brief

Lately, Deep Learning has had a tremendous amount of attention especially in medical field. In this project you will be required to design, develop, analyse and evaluate an appropriate deep learning model. You can build your own model or use a pretrained model with your layers added to it. You will explore the dataset and then apply that model to a dataset of your choosing. You will need to evaluate the performance in terms of precision, recall, F1-score, ROC-curve and PR-curve. You will need to compare models to add more value to the analysis. You will discuss the findings that have been produced, and critically reflect upon the model and its predictions. 

## Project Task:

ECG Heartbeat classification.


### The components you must complete are:

1.	Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the dataset chosen to demonstrate the dataset characteristics by summarising the dataset (e.g., data imbalance/data distribution) and formalising the rationale of the task 

2.	Select suitable models for the task chosen and then pre-process your data in a suitable format to be fed to those models 
3.	Build, train and validate the models that allow for the task specified and that are going to be used in your evaluations 
4.	Apply hyperparameter-tuning to get the best model to get better predictions on the validation set 
5.	Evaluate the modelsâ€™ predictions using the metrics stated above. 
6.	Present your findings with suitable visualisations 
7.	Critically evaluate and discuss the whole process, the findings and what can be improved
